Additionally, users can choose to create their own customized career portal instead of using the pre-configured and provided link from finest jobs.\n\nIt is important to note that when publishing job openings through multiposting, it is crucial to evaluate which scheduling options are worthwhile and successful. For this purpose, rexx Recruiting already provides powerful evaluation possibilities through its data warehouse and the pre-configured and provided connection to the rexx Matomo. The Matomo data is stored in a DSGVO-compliant manner.\n\nOverall, multiposting in rexx Recruiting makes it easy to publish job openings on over 1000 job boards with just a few clicks.",

Automatic Time Zone Detection: This feature automatically detects the time zone of the applicant and sets it accordingly. This can help reduce misunderstandings and errors caused by time zone differences. However, it is possible that the automatic time zone detection may not function correctly in some cases. To solve this problem, a time zone IQ was implemented, which supports the correct determination of the time zone by considering various factors. In rexx recruiting, a \"Vorgabewert Zeitzone\" (recommended value for the time zone) is provided, which can be entered into the job application form. This field can be automatically filled with the time zone set in the PC settings.\n2. Manual Time Zone Configuration: Users can also manually configure the time zone by selecting a value from the list of available time zones. In the rexx recruiting system, the time zone is set per position, and the system will use the selected time zone for all communications related to that position. If no time zone is specified, the system will use the default time zone set in the PC settings.\n\nTo configure time zones in rexx, users can follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to the rexx recruiting system.\n2. Navigate to the \"Personal\" menu and select \"User Setup\".\n3. In the \"Time Zone\" section, select the desired time zone from the list of available time zones.\n4. If necessary, enter a recommended value for the time zone in the \"Vorgabewert Zeitzone\" field.\n5. Save the changes by clicking on the \"Speichern\" button.\n\nBy following these steps, users can configure the time zone in rexx to their preferences.",

The module offers many configuration options to optimize the dialogue and content of conversations. In companies with highly developed conversation processes, hierarchical or holistic organizational structures, there may be a desire to extend the conversation process by adding additional levels. At the conversation process, employees and superiors, but also project leaders, HR, and other specialist departments within the company can be involved. The introduction of multiple conversation managers is already possible.\n\nThe Gesprächsmanagement B/C function extends the conversation process by allowing for a system-side free extension of the process. Primarily, it is about digitally signing or confirming that certain roles in the system have seen or approved the documented conversation result. This extension occurs independently of the conversation process and status, and is not dependent on the previous conversation. The new role can be introduced either by digitally signing off on the documented conversation result or by incorporating Gesprächsmanagement B/C after the conversation between Gesprächsmanagement 1 and an employee.\n\nThe new role is created by defining a new GM-Function, which is essentially a free process extension within the system. The extension occurs independently of the conversation process and status, and is not dependent on the previous conversation. The new role can be introduced either by digitally signing off on the documented conversation result or by incorporating Gesprächsmanagement B/C after the conversation between Gespruchsmanagement 1 and an employee.\n\nThe following new columns are provided in the conversation list for Gesprächsmanagement B/C:\n\n* Name/n of Gespruchsmanagement B\n* GM B Status: This can be set to a defined status in the system data.\n\nIn the contact entry, nothing is displayed regarding the conversation. Within the digital file, an independent setting can be made that ablished conversations are displayed in a PDF document. After the conversation has been conducted, it will be printed and signed by the MA and Gespruchsmanager, and then scanned. The scan manager will identify the conversation based on the QR code and create a contact entry with the conversation type according to system settings.\n\nThe Gesprächsmanagement B/C function can be used to extend the conversation process by adding additional levels.

The lower profile determines the value that a right takes, while the higher profiles overwrite or supplement the lower ones. The order of the profiles is important, as it determines the final value of the rights. When creating a new profile, you can either duplicate an existing one or create a new one from scratch. If you duplicate an existing profile, the new profile will inherit the settings of the original profile. If you create a new profile from scratch, you can configure the rights independently of the existing profiles.\n\nIn Rexx Systems Human Resource Software, you can combine multiple profiles into a single profile by following these steps:\n\n1. Open the Berechtigungsprofile overview in the Admin section of the software.\n2. Click on the \"Neu\" button to create a new profile.\n3. Give the new profile a name and configure the rights as desired.\n4. Save the new profile.\n5. Go back to the Berechtigungsprofile overview and drag and drop the new profile onto an existing profile.\n6. The combined profiles will be displayed in a stacked format, with the lower profile determining the final value of the rights.\n\nAlternatively, you can also combine profiles by copying an existing profile and then configuring the rights independently of the original profile.
